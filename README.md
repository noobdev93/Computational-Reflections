# 🧠 Adaptive Learning Curriculum: JavaScript Foundations through Cognitive Systems

A multi-phase curriculum blending **JavaScript programming**, **logic and computation**, and **philosophy of systems and cognition** — designed for learners who value both technical fluency and reflective understanding.

---

## 📘 Overview

This curriculum treats programming as both a **technical craft** and a **philosophical discipline** — training computational thinking while exploring the cognitive, systemic, and ethical dimensions of design, feedback, and adaptation.

- **Language Focus:** JavaScript (primary), Python (introduced later)
- **Environment:** Cursor IDE (VS Code compatible) + Node.js
- **Time Commitment:** ~4 hours/week
- **Core Lens:** Logic, Computation, and Cognitive Systems
- **Secondary Themes:** Cybernetics, Systems Design, and Philosophy of Technology

## 🌱 Phase 0 – Computational Intuition & Conceptual Grounding

> Before learning to code, learn to *see like a system* and *reason like a computer.*

**Goals:**
- Build mental models of computation and feedback.
- Understand the computer as both a logical and embodied medium.
- Cultivate comfort with the terminal, file systems, and structured thought.

**Topics:**
- What is computation? The logic of information.
- How systems represent and process knowledge.
- Input/output, loops, and feedback.
- The craft of code as attention and care.

**Resources:**
- Bret Victor – *Learnable Programming*  
- Matthew Crawford – *Shop Class as Soulcraft*  
- CS50 Week 0 – *What is Computer Science?*  
- [Node.js Crash Course (Traversy Media)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4)  
- Cursor IDE + Node terminal for exploration

**Project:**
- Write a short reflection titled **“How I Think a Computer Thinks.”**

## 🧩 Phase 1 – Logic & Language

> Learn how computers reason through syntax and flow.

**Goals:**
- Understand variables, logic, and basic data structures.
- Develop precision through debugging and iteration.
- Explore how control flow mirrors reasoning and decision-making.

**Topics:**
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- Control Flow: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`  
- Functions, Scope, and Modular Thinking  
- The Terminal as Dialogue  
- Debugging as Reflective Inquiry  

**Resources:**
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)  
- Alan Turing – *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*  
- Computerphile – *How Computers Think*

**Project:**
- Build a **Command-Line “Reasoning Engine”** — a Node.js tool that takes user input and returns outcomes based on logical rules.

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Data, Structure, and Abstraction

> Move from thinking *in* code to thinking *with* code.

**Goals:**
- Organize and transform data meaningfully.
- Build composable systems using arrays, objects, and functions.
- Reflect on abstraction as both a cognitive and ethical practice.

**Topics:**
- Arrays, Objects, and JSON  
- Functions and Closures  
- File Operations (`fs` module)  
- Recursion and Feedback  
- Concept: *Abstraction as Thought*

**Resources:**
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)  
- Herbert Simon – *The Sciences of the Artificial*  
- [MDN: Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)

**Project:**
- Create a **CLI “Habit Simulator”** that models adaptive routines through feedback loops.

---

## 🧮 Phase 3 – Logic, Systems, and Cognitive Modeling

> Explore reasoning, learning, and self-correction.

**Goals:**
- Connect logic to adaptive and systemic behavior.
- Learn event-driven and asynchronous programming.
- Reflect on feedback as a core principle of intelligence.

**Topics:**
- Boolean Logic and Conditional Reasoning  
- Event Loops and Async Flow  
- Randomness and Probability  
- Error as Information  
- Concept: *Feedback as Learning*

**Resources:**
- Gregory Bateson – *Steps to an Ecology of Mind*  
- Kurzgesagt – *Cybernetics: Feedback and Control*  
- Norbert Wiener – *Cybernetics* (excerpts)

**Project:**
- Build an **“Adaptive Feedback Simulator”** that responds dynamically to user inputs.

---

## 🔍 Phase 4 – Technology, Design, and Self-Organization

> Learn how distributed systems coordinate without central control.

**Goals:**
- Understand architecture and emergent order.
- Model consensus and DAO-inspired coordination.
- Consider ethical design in decentralized systems.

**Topics:**
- Asynchronous Programming (`async/await`, Promises)  
- Event Systems and APIs  
- Networks and Decentralization  
- DAO Simulation Concepts  
- Systems Ethics and Responsibility  

**Resources:**
- Stafford Beer – *Designing Freedom*  
- Don Ihde – *Philosophy of Technology*  
- Martin Kleppmann – *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*

**Project:**
- Prototype a **“Consensus Simulator”** — a Node.js script where multiple agents coordinate decisions.

---

## 🧠 Phase 5 – Integration, Reflection, and Philosophy of Code

> Unite technical skill and philosophical depth into a lived methodology.

**Goals:**
- Synthesize technical fluency with reflective understanding.
- Explore computation as a medium for meaning and ethics.
- Bridge JavaScript systems with Python simulations.

**Topics:**
- Process Philosophy and Adaptive Systems  
- Pragmatism and the Growth of Meaning  
- The Ethics of Automation  
- Concept: *Knowing Computationally*

**Resources:**
- Dewey – *Experience and Nature*  
- Whitehead – *Process and Reality* (selections)  
- Andy Clark – *Surfing Uncertainty*

**Final Project:**
- Build a **JS–Python hybrid system** or write a **“Philosophy of Code”** essay exploring ethics in adaptive technology.

## 🪞 Reflection and Practice Log

> Philosophy becomes real when practiced.

Maintain a `/reflections` folder in your repo containing:

- Monthly **Concept Notes** (`01_concept.md`)  
- **Experiment Logs** (`02_experiment.md`)  
- **Integration Reflections** (`03_reflection.md`)  

Templates are stored in `/templates` for reuse.

**Prompts:**
- “What does debugging teach about attention and care?”  
- “When I automate a process, what judgment am I encoding?”  
- “How does abstraction change the way I perceive systems?”
